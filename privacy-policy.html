Policy</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%">Your privacy is
very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this policy in
order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and make
use of personal information. The following outlines our privacy
policy. Our privacy policy is GDPR compliant.

When accessing the Say Hi app, we will learn certain
information about you during your visit. Please note that Stranger
Chat is an anonymous chat app and you do not need to provide any of
your Personal Information to us or to other users. Say Hi app
also does not store messages or images except the profile data you
provide to us.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%">Similar to other
commercial applications, Say Hi app utilizes a standard
technology called 'cookies' (see explanation below) and server logs
to collect information about how our site is used. Information
gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date and
time of visits, time spent at our app, and the apps visited just
before and just after our own, as well as your IP address.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%"><B>Use of Cookies</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%">A cookie is a
very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique
identifier. When you visit an app, that site's computer or mobile
phone asks your computer or mobile phone for permission to store
file. Each app can send its own cookie to your browser if your
browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your
browser only permits a app to access the cookies it has already sent
to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%"><B>IP Addresses</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in; line-height: 150%">IP addresses are
used by your computer or mobile phone every time you are connected to
the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computer or
mobile phones on the network to identify your computer or mobile
phone. IP addresses are automatically collected by our web server as
part of demographic and profile data known as “traffic data” so
that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you.</P>
